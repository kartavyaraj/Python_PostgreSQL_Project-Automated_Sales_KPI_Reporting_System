## Overview
The _Automated Sales KPI Reporting System_ Project is a Python-based automation system that streamlines the entire data reporting process — from data extraction to final PDF report creation. It connects to a database, performs data validation and KPI calculations, generates insightful charts, compiles them into a well-formatted PDF report, and sends it via email — all in one seamless workflow.

This project eliminates repetitive manual reporting tasks and ensures faster, more accurate business insights, making it ideal for automating reporting operations.

## Project Description

This project automates the entire sales reporting process by connecting directly to a PostgreSQL database, fetching and merging data from multiple sales-related tables, and computing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, profit, transactions, and discount loss. Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, it generates insightful visual reports which are automatically compiled into a PDF and delivered via email.

By removing manual reporting tasks, this system ensures consistent, accurate, and timely business insights — enabling data-driven decision-making and improved efficiency across sales operations.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to design and implement a fully automated reporting system that extracts, analyzes, and visualizes sales data directly from a database, eliminate manual reporting, ensure accuracy in KPI tracking (revenue, profit, and discounts), and automatically deliver performance reports — enabling faster, data-driven decision-making for business teams.

## Dataset Description

The dataset is sourced from a simulated retail sales environment and stored in a PostgreSQL database. It consists of four interrelated tables that collectively capture customer, product, store, and transaction information.

- ***Customers*** → Contains customer demographics and onboarding details, including CustomerID, Name, Gender, BirthDate, City, and JoinDate.

- ***Products*** → Includes product-level details such as ProductID, ProductName, Category, SubCategory, UnitPrice, and CostPrice.

- ***Stores*** → Provides information about each store, including StoreID, StoreName, City, and Region.

- ***Transactions*** → Records each sales transaction with fields like TransactionID, Trans_Date, CustomerID, ProductID, StoreID, Quantity, Discount, and PaymentMethod.    

These tables are linked using primary–foreign key relationships, allowing efficient joins and generation of consolidated reports for KPI and trend analysis.ns.

## Project Workflow & Automation Steps

This project follows a modular and automated workflow divided into six Python scripts, each handling a specific stage of the reporting pipeline — from data extraction to email delivery.

1. **Database Connection & Data Validation**

    Purpose: Establish connection with the PostgreSQL database and prepare a clean, merged dataset.
    Process:
    - A SQL engine is created using the *SQLAlchemy* library.
    - Multiple database tables are joined using SQL queries to form a single consolidated *merged_df*.
    - A data validation step checks for:
        - Missing (NULL) values
        - Duplicate records
    - If any data quality issue is detected, an error is raised to ensure clean inputs for analysis.

2. **KPI Generation**

    Purpose: Calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) for business insights.
    Process:
    - A function computes Key important metrics:
        - Total Transactions
        - Total Revenue
        - Quantity Sold
        - Total Profit
        - Total Discount Loss
    - The KPIs are stored for later inclusion in the automated report.

3. **Visualization Creation**

    Purpose: Generate visual insights from the data.
    Process:
    - Functions use *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* to create professional-looking charts:
        - Pie Charts:
            - Revenue by Category
            - Revenue by Store
            - Revenue by Payment
            - Revenue by Gender
        - Bar Charts:
            - Top 10 Products by Revenue
            - Subcategories by Revenue
        - Each chart is saved locally for embedding into the final report.

4. **PDF Report Generation**

    Purpose: Combine KPIs and visualizations into a professional report.
    Process:
    - Using the *FPDF* library, all charts and metrics are compiled into a well-formatted *PDF report*.
    - The PDF includes a header, KPI summary section, and visualization pages for clarity and readability.
    - PDF also saved locally for further use if needed.

5. **Email Automation**

    Purpose: Automatically deliver the generated report via email.
    Process:
    - The *smtplib* library is used to send emails.
    - Email contains:
        - A custom message body 
        - The PDF report attached
    - Ensures stakeholders receive up-to-date sales reports without manual effort.

6. **Main Script Execution**

    Purpose: Orchestrate the entire automation pipeline.
    Process:
    - Sequentially executes all previous functions:
        - Connect to database and validate data
        - Generate KPIs 
        - Create visualizations
        - Compile PDF report
        - Send email with attachment
    - After successful execution, an email with the complete Sales KPI Report will be sent to the Reciever's Email ID — fully automated from start to finish.

**You can view an example of the PDF report in the _report/_ folder.**
